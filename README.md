Ortur obsidian firmware

So i got this firmware from Ortur.
For the moment I wasn't able to compile it (due to lack of knowledge).

If you manage to make something interesting from it, please keep me in touch.

Also, i have lot of other file in the Arduino_Code, but too big to push them...

All files are from https://orturtech.wetransfer.com/downloads/03a3459576368404fd214c087096933120211007154337/de9d92
